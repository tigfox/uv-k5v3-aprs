# F4HWN firmware port for the UV-K1 and UV-K5 V3 using the PY32F071 MCU

This repository is a fork of the [F4HWN custom firmware](https://github.com/armel/uv-k5-firmware-custom), who was a fork of [Egzumer custom firmware](https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom). It extends the work done for the UV-K5 V1, based on the DP32G030 MCU, and adapts it to the newer UV-K1 and UV-K5 V3 built around the PY32F071 MCU. It is the result of the joint work of [@muzkr](https://github.com/muzkr) and [@armel](https://github.com/armel).

A big thanks to DualTachyon, who paved the way by releasing the very first open-source [firmware](https://github.com/DualTachyon/uv-k5-firmware) for the UV-K5 V1. None of this would have been possible without that initial work !

# A note for developers who intend to fork this project

This firmware is distributed under the Apache 2.0 License, carrying forward the original copyright of DualTachyon, whose work laid the foundation for the UV-K5 open-source ecosystem.
If you create a fork or a derived version, **we strongly encourage you to keep your work open source**.

Keeping your fork open:

- aligns with the intent and spirit of the Apache 2.0 License
- supports the amateur-radio and embedded-development community

## Main features and improvements from F4HWN

> **APRS build:** this fork adds an `APRS` preset (receive, beacon, messages, digipeater). See [APRS.md](APRS.md).

### Fusion edition

Fusion is the generic reference edition for the UV-K1 and UV-K5 V3. It is intended
for everyday use and is the base inherited by the specialized editions. It includes:

- Fagci's spectrum analyzer,
- broadcast FM radio and VOX,
- [UV Studio](https://armel.github.io/uvstudio/) with integrated K5Viewer screen mirroring, screenshots and remote keyboard control,
- advanced RX audio profiles and Audio Scope,
- automatic RX/TX activity logging with RF Log,
- Full Watch across VFO A, VFO B and up to two priority channels,
- Multiboot with one protected Main backup and four user firmware slots,
- independent Multiconfig banks, switchable at runtime through `SetCfg`.

Specialized presets extend Fusion for specific uses:

- **Transfer** adds AirCopy and BEAM wireless channel transfer.
- **FieldOps** adds first-responder controls, Fox Hunt and Morse Beacon support.
- **Labs** is the experimental edition. It carries the broad feature selection of the
  other releases and adds the overlay-apps platform (apps loaded from external Flash and
  run in a 4 KiB RAM overlay) — the newest, least-settled work. Expect rough edges. It is
  not a strict superset of every other edition: features may be exchanged between releases
  to preserve stability and memory headroom.
- **Custom** remains a manually configured build based directly on the hidden technical default.

### Multiboot and Multiconfig

Multiboot uses the radio's external Flash to keep one automatically maintained
**Main** firmware backup and four additional firmware slots. Each image is
validated before it is restored to internal Flash, and the selector displays
the edition and version stored in every valid slot.

To open the Multiboot selector, power off the radio, hold `MENU`, power it on,
then release the key when the selector appears. Use `UP` and `DOWN` to choose a
slot, `MENU` to restore it and `EXIT` to leave without making changes.

> [!CAUTION]
> Never power off the radio while a firmware slot is being restored.

Multiconfig provides one independent configuration bank for Main and for each
of the four user slots. A bank contains the memory channels and names, VFO
settings, scan lists, radio settings and edition-specific settings. By default,
each firmware slot uses the bank with the same number.

The `SetCfg` menu can select and apply another bank immediately, without
restarting the radio or changing firmware. The status bar shows the active bank
as `CFG M` or `CFG 1` to `CFG 4`, so several operating configurations can be
used with the same firmware and compatible configurations can be shared across
editions.

### Full Watch

Full Watch extends the normal dual-watch cycle to monitor:

- VFO A,
- VFO B,
- priority channel 1,
- priority channel 2.

The priority channels come from the existing scan-list priority settings.
Duplicates, invalid entries and channels already loaded in VFO A or B are
ignored automatically.

The `RxMode` menu provides two Full Watch modes:

- `FULL RX / RESPOND` replies on the channel that opened the squelch,
- `MAIN TX / FULL RX` always transmits on the selected main VFO.

Animated chevrons show the background watch cycle while the normal VFO display
remains available for navigation and operation.

### Overlay applications and APRS

Labs can store up to 16 applications from the current collection of 18 in
external Flash. Each app is loaded into a dedicated 4 KiB RAM overlay only
while it is running, while larger read-only assets such as text, fonts, bitmaps
and lookup tables remain in external Flash.

The current app collection includes:

- radio tools: Broadcast FM, Fox Hunt, Beacon, Beam and Spectrum3D,
- digital and signal apps: APRS RX, APRS TX, SSTV and EPIRB 406,
- diagnostics: System Info,
- games and demos: Breakout, Cube3D, Minesweeper, Plasma, Rapid Roll, Snake,
  Space Impact and Tetris.

APRS RX receives AX.25 UI frames using Bell 202 AFSK at 1200 baud, displays
common position formats and Mic-E data, and keeps a five-frame history. APRS TX
provides an on-radio editor for the source callsign and SSID, digipeater path,
position, symbol and comment before transmitting a position beacon.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Overlay apps, including APRS RX and APRS TX, are experimental and intended for
> Labs. Use the app files supplied with the same firmware release so their ABI
> and required capabilities match the installed firmware.

> [!CAUTION]
> Transmitting apps must only be used on frequencies, power levels and modes
> permitted by your licence and local regulations.

#### AirCopy (Transfer edition)

AirCopy can transfer one 128-channel bank, the radio settings, or all memory
banks and settings in one operation. Version 6.1 adds a stop-and-wait protocol
with acknowledgements in both directions:

- the receiver acknowledges CRC32 comparison frames and every stored data frame,
- a missing acknowledgement automatically triggers a retry, up to three times,
- invalid, out-of-sequence or mismatched selections are rejected instead of
  being applied silently,
- the progress screen reports retries or receive errors and distinguishes
  blocks that were already identical from blocks that were copied.

Before sending data, the two radios compare CRC32 values in groups of up to 24
blocks. The receiver returns a difference bitmap, so only blocks whose contents
differ are transmitted. Each radio data frame can carry up to three consecutive
64-byte blocks, approximately doubling over-the-air throughput compared with
the previous one-block framing.

Transfer also supports direct radio-to-radio cable cloning over UART at 460800
baud. Press `*` in AirCopy to switch between `AIR COPY` and `CABLE COPY`; use
`UP` and `DOWN` to select a memory bank, `Settings` or `All (Mem+Set)`, then
`MENU` on the sender and `EXIT` on the receiver.

Cable mode additionally provides `Flash 2M`, which clones the complete 2 MiB
external Flash. Sectors are compared by CRC32 and only different sectors are
written. The device-specific calibration sector is never copied or erased, and
the receiving radio must be restarted after a successful Flash clone.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The new AirCopy wire format is not compatible with earlier versions. Both
> radios must run the same firmware version.

 ## Manual

Up to date manual is available in the [Wiki section](https://github.com/armel/uv-k1-k5v3-firmware-custom/wiki)

## Radio performance

Please note that the Quansheng UV-Kx radios are not professional quality transceivers, their
performance is strictly limited. The RX front end has no track-tuned band pass filtering
at all, and so are wide band/wide open to any and all signals over a large frequency range.

Using the radio in high intensity RF environments will most likely make reception difficult,
especially in AM mode. The receiver simply does not have a great dynamic range, so stronger
signals can easily cause distortion, desensitization and poor AM audio.
This is fundamentally a hardware limitation: firmware can improve behavior at the margins, but
it cannot overcome the front-end design of the radio.
In practice, AM reception will degrade first and most severely, while FM reception is generally
more tolerant and should remain more usable.

But, they are nice toys for the price, fun to play with.

## Compiling and Building from Docker

This project provides a Docker-based build system for the UV-K1 and UV-K5 V3.
Everything is handled through the `compile-firmware.sh` helper script. Fusion is
the default generic preset, while specialized builds are generated in their own
`build/<Preset>` directories.

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system
- Bash environment (Linux, macOS, WSL, Git Bash on Windows)

### Build Script Overview

The script `compile-firmware.sh`:

1. Builds the Docker image (`uvk1-uvk5v3`) if it does not already exist.
2. Configures the selected preset with `cmake --fresh`.
3. Builds the firmware and outputs matching `.elf`, `.bin` and `.hex` files.
4. Displays Flash and RAM usage; `All` keeps the individual build logs quiet.

### Usage

```bash
./compile-firmware.sh [Preset] [extra CMake options]
```

The default preset is **Fusion**. Available presets are:

- **Custom**
- **Fusion**
- **Transfer**
- **FieldOps**
- **Labs**
- **All** (Fusion, Transfer, FieldOps and Labs)

Examples:

```bash
./compile-firmware.sh
./compile-firmware.sh Fusion
./compile-firmware.sh Transfer
./compile-firmware.sh FieldOps
./compile-firmware.sh Labs
./compile-firmware.sh All
```

### Passing Additional CMake Options

You can pass extra configuration options after the preset name.  
These are forwarded directly to `cmake --preset` inside the container.

Examples:

```bash
./compile-firmware.sh FieldOps -DENABLE_VOX=OFF
./compile-firmware.sh Fusion -DENABLE_FEAT_F4HWN_GAME=ON
./compile-firmware.sh Fusion -DSQL_TONE=600
```

To prepare the rolling development firmware:

```bash
./compile-firmware.sh Fusion -DDEV=ON
```

This keeps the regular build output in `build/Fusion` and also updates
`archive/f4hwn.fusion.development.bin`. The development build is identified as
`DEV` in the firmware information screen. Publishing the updated archive file
remains an explicit Git operation.

### Notes

- The first run may take a few minutes while Docker builds the base image.
- Each build runs inside Docker, so your host environment remains clean.

## Flashing the Firmware with UV Studio

You can flash the UV-K5 V3 and UV-K1 directly from your web browser using the Web Serial-based [UV Studio](https://armel.github.io/uvstudio/).

UV Studio combines firmware flashing, calibration maintenance, boot-logo management, K5Viewer and RF Log in a single interface. It requires no application installation, server or account. Use a desktop browser with Web Serial support, such as Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera or Firefox 151+.

## Steps to flash the firmware

- Open the [Flash Firmware](https://armel.github.io/uvstudio/#flash) view in UV Studio.
- Connect your radio to your computer using a compatible USB programming cable (USB-C or Baofeng/Kenwood like double jack USB cable).
- Make sure your radio is in **DFU mode (flash mode)**.
- Select an official F4HWN Fusion release from the catalog or load a local `.bin` firmware file.
- Click on `Flash Firmware`, then select the serial port associated with your radio.
- The progress bar will guide you through the flashing steps.

Once finished, your radio restarts with the new firmware.

## Steps to dump or restore calibration data

[UV Studio](https://armel.github.io/uvstudio/) can also dump and restore calibration data, which is highly recommended. It is best to create a dump immediately after installing the F4HWN firmware, and to restore it before installing another firmware or returning to the stock firmware.

### Dump

- Open the [Dump Calibration](https://armel.github.io/uvstudio/#dump-calib) view in UV Studio.
- Power on your radio in **normal mode**.
- Click `Dump Calibration Data`.

When the process is complete, click `Download calibration.dat` to save the file to your computer.

> [!NOTE]
> A good practice is to rename your calibration file using the serial number of your radio, which you can find on the label on the back of the device once you remove the battery. This helps avoid mixing up calibration files when you own multiple units.

### Restore

- Open the [Restore Calibration](https://armel.github.io/uvstudio/#restore-calib) view in UV Studio.
- Power on your radio in **normal mode**.
- Select your `calibration.dat` file on your computer.

Click `Restore Calibration Data` and wait until the process fully completes.
